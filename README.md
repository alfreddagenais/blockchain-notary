A very simple and the second most logical Blockchain app leaveraging Smart Contracts.

### Before you get started

Remember that a blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the important thing is that theyâ€™re chained together using hashes.


### How it works

Blockchain Notary is an open source service that computes the cryptographic hash for your documents and store this cryptographic information on the Blockchain.

We use the SHA-2 algorithm to compute hash for your files and we never get to actually upload your file anywhere to a server. This means that your document content is 100% secured and cryptographically protected along the way.

Using our service, you will get the ultimate proof of your digital document yet it's secure and nobody but you gets to access the content whilst everyone will have an ability to verify it's authenticity. Yeah, and that's how it works really.  Blockchain rules.
